# NZ_Educational_Library

My first ever website developement and the intent was to have an educational website that incorporated Te Reo (native language of New Zealand) to aid the young one in understanding two main languages spoke/used in NZ. 

Waterfall methodology was used along with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. As this site is for learning purpose, got to understand how wireframes, sitemaps, SDLC is used. Furthermore, understanding and conducting test cases on each page of the site.
